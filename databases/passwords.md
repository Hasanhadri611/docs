# Database Passwords
Database passwords are set at instance creation time, but may be changed. The first password is created by either you, or Amezmo.
Amezmo provides an autogenerated password at instance creation time, however, you may provide your own.

## Changing your password

If you need to change your database password, please be sure,
since we will not be able to ask you to confirm your current password, since we do not store it.
Navigate to the Database tab of your instance. Under the Database Configuration section, click on the Change button

Enter your new password in the fields, then click Change Password.
Changing your password will take effect immediately.
Please be sure any of your code that references the old password is updated. Be sure to update your DotEnv
configuration if your application uses values in a `.env` file.
