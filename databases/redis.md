# Redis

If you've chosen Redis at instance creation time, then you'll have a Redis server available. This instance of
Redis can be access from any of your shared instances. Redis is not exposed to the Internet.

    **Note**: If you chose Redis in the application creation wizard, then Redis is installed
    and listening on the default port. See
    <a href="/docs/instances/ports-and-ip-addresses">ports and IP addresses</a> for more information.
