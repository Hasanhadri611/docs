# Deployments with Git

Amezmo is a Git-first deployment platform that supports GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket 
with automatic deployments and a suite of
[deployments hooks](/docs/deployments/hooks). 
Each time you push, Amezmo will start a new deployment. Optionally,
you may disable automatic deployments and deploy branches of your choice.
