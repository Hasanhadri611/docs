# PHP Deployments with Git

Amezmo supports GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket with automatic deployments and a suite of
[deployments hooks](/docs/deployments/hooks) Each time you push, Amezmo will start a new deployment. Optionally,
you may disable automatic deployments in one click.

## Deployment modes
Deployment modes affect what happens by default when a deployment starts.

### Automatic
