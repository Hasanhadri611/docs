# Deployments with Git

Amezmo is a Git-first deployment platform that supports GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket 
with automatic deployments and a suite of
[deployments hooks](/docs/deployments/hooks). 
Each time you push, Amezmo will start a new deployment. Optionally,
you may disable automatic deployments and deploy branches of your choice.

- [Branches](/docs/git/branches)
- [Git providers](/docs/git/providers)
- [Repos](/docs/git/repos)
- [Tag-based deployments](/docs/git/tag-based-deployments)

## Automation
[Learn more](/docs/deployments/automatic-composer-installs) about automatically
installing composer packages and running migrations without having to write a custom
script.
