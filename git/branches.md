# Git Branches

[Deployments](/docs/deployments) on Amezmo always begin with a Git repository and a branch chosen for automatic deployment. 

## Automatic Deployment Branch
The automatic deployment branch is the branch that triggers a new [deployment](/docs/deployments) when commits are made to it. This branch is chosen during the 
Git repository import step, but you may change it at anytime.
