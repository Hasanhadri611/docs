# Team Owners

As a team owner you may invite
[role-based team members](/docs/teams/team-member-roles), revoke team member access, and
view security logs of actions that team members' have taken.

Team owners have the most power and may revoke team members' access.
There may only be one team owner per team. The team owner role is automatically assigned to your
account when you create a team.
