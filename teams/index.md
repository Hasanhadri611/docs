# Amezmo for Teams

Teams on Amezmo gives you the ability to invite other people to your Team Account and isolate team members into
specific roles.

Teams are powerful in that you may create multiple teams under one Amezmo account, and switch teams at anytime
without logging out. Administrators and Team owners may launch instances under the Team account.

Each team you create has its own payment method.
Instances that are launched from within a team will be billed to the default payment method for the team.
