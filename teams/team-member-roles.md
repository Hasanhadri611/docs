# Roles

Team members are associated with a Role which limits their ability to take actions within the dashboard and API.
Team member roles limit what a team member may do. Amezmo provides two different team member roles:

### Administrator

Allows for complete management of instances. Similar to the permissions and capabilities that the Team Owner
has except this role cannot manage billing, view security logs, or manage the team.

### Client

Allows managing billing, viewing invoices and estimated bill. This role is intended for your non-technical client
that does not manage instances, but where you manage their website and they pay Amezmo directly.
