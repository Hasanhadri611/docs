# Pausing

Pausing an instance takes it offline, but doesn't [terminate](/docs/instances/terminating) it.
The instance is shutdown and inbound requests
to the instance will not be possible. Pausing is similar to shutting down your own computer.

Of course, upon pausing
your Instance on Amezmo, your data will be persisted. Then, when you start your Instance, your data will be in the
same state as it was when you Paused it.

To bring your Instance back up, press the Start button on the instance Overview page.

   <b>Note</b>: Instances in a Paused state will still incur the hourly charge.
