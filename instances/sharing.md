# Instance sharing

Applications may be shared with other [instances](/docs/instances) on Amezmo. This means that
the instance will be joined with another instances private network. 

Instances are shared with another instance. The instance in which sharing is configured will get a 
new IP address that will be within the range of network of the peer instance. Once two instances are shared, they become peers on one network. The **requester** of sharing is the instance that will have its IP changed, not the receiver.
