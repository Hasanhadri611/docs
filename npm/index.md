# NPM

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed and configured by default
with full support for installing packages globally. Common utility packages such as `cross-env` are installed by default.
To see what's installed by default, see the global package directory inside your instance at `/home/deployer/.npm-global/bin`
