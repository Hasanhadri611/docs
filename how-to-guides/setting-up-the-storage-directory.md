# Setting up the storage directory

The storage directory must persist between deployments. Storage directories commonly store user uploaded data. You may configure your application
to run a [before.deploy](/docs/deployments/hooks/after-pull) script to setup your storage directory. See below for complete example scripts.

To create a persistent storage directory, copy the script from one of the links below.
