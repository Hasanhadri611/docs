## Storage

Storage on Amezmo is designed for data in which you need to persist between deployments. This data
may be user uploaded content, or files that you've uploaded via your application. Nonethless, the data needs to be available in the same place regardless of which version of your application
is currently [released](https://www.amezmo.com/docs/deployments/directories).

See the below how-to guide for application specific instructions.
