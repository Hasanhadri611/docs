# Pricing and Billing

On Amezmo, you only pay for what you use. This means that every instance you launch is billed on a per-hour basis.
Although pricing on the [pricing page](/pricing) is listed per month, the underlying billing basis is hourly.
Hourly pricing allows you to be billed at the same time every month and to be charged only once for every instance
that you've launched during the prior month.
