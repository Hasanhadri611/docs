## Amezmo billing credits

Amezmo credits are applied to invoices and reduce the total amount due. Credits are applied 
until the credit amount is completely spent, or it expires. 

Credits are applied in the form of a promotion code. Once a promotion code is applied, it will be used to cover the total amount due on invoices. After a promotion is applied to an invoice, the available credit amount is subtracted by the amount of credit used on the invoice which is considered the "spend" of a coupon. 

## Balances
Credit are applied to your account balance. You may see your account balance by going from Profile > Billing.

## Applying Credits
If you have a promotion code, you may apply the code to your account from Billing > Credits.
