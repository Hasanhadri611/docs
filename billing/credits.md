## Amezmo billing credits

Amezmo credits are applied to invoices and reduce the total amount due. Credits are applied 
until the credit amount is completely spent, or it expires. 

Credits are applied in the form of a coupon code. Once a coupon code is applied, it will be used to cover the total amount due on invoices. After a coupon is applied to an invoice, the available credit amount is subtracted by the amount of credit used on the invoice which is considered the "spend" of a coupon.
